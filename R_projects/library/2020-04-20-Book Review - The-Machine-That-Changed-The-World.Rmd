The drivers for this research was the increasingly market share gained by Japanese companies at that time. The research project was named International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) and it received government and enterprise fund to support the work that took 5 years to be completed.

The book, contains the agreed uppon findings that set the differences, advantages and disadvantages of both manufacturing methods. Also, it tells the story of these methods and how the companies are making the change to a lean methodology.
