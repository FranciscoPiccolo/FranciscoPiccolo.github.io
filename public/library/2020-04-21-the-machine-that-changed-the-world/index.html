<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The Machine that Changed the World is a complete guide in the Lean Methodology, covering every aspect of this practice in the automotive industry in a project that spent 5 million US$ during five years aiming to investigate the differences between the Lean Practices and Mass Production.</p>
<p>The reason for the research was the growing share of the market being acquired by Japanese companies in the automotive sector. After the end of the project (1985-1990) the members prefered to write this book instead of a white paper research. Members of the project (MIT professors and industries specialists) agree that Lean Production is superior to Mass Production and it can be applied in any industries in any society, but they’re aware of the challenged to make the move.</p>
<p>This overview will highlight the main findings of each chapter and present some data from the book that support the authors’s conclusion about the superiority of the lean methodoogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“the adoption of lean production, as it inevitably spreads beyond the auto industry, will change everything in almost every industry - choices for consumers, the nature of work, the fortune of companies, and ultimately, the fate of natios.”</p>

<h2><strong>Cap.1 The industry of industries in transition</strong></h2>
<p>In this chapter, the autors show the importance of the automotive industry and how it made nations thrive as economic leaders in the world. At the time of the writen, the automotive industry was trying to move to lean production, thus the focus of this chapter is to give a glimpse about the lean methodology and the key differences when compared to mass production. Some quotes of this chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The lean production combines the advantages of craft and mass production, while avoiding the high cost of the former and the rigidity of the later.”"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Lean production is ‘lean’ because it uses less of everything compared with mass production.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><strong>Cap.2 The rise and fall of mass production</strong></h2>
<p>This chapter presents how the mass production begun, explaining its craft production predecessor and the differences between these two methodologies related to product design, work force and organization structure. It also explain that Henry Ford mass production insight was a unique point in the auto industry history but it wouldn’t reach too far without the management knowledge of Alfred Sloan of General Motors.</p>
<p>The craft production, that started around 1890 can be summed up by the following characteristcs:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Highly specialised work force.</p></li>
<li><p>Decentralized organizations.</p></li>
<li><p>Low production volume (less than 1.000 vehicles a year with the same design).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In 1908 Ford’s Model T was designed and it was a remarcable achievement because this product allowed manufacturing in high scale and it was user frienly (the contrary of the cars developed using craft based methods).</p>
