      <description>OverviewThis book is the tipical book reference for a given subject, and when the theme is Econometrics, this material is highly recommended for economics grad students. For its importance, in this post I’ll present a brief summary of each chapter and solve some exercises (because the book doesn’t present the answer for the problems). Also, I’ll release the datasets used on the problems on my github account.
The authors aimed to build a material that would serve all levels of students that want learn econometrics.</description>

      <description>OverviewEste livro faz parte de uma coleção da Universidade de Cambridge - Cambridge Series in Statistics and Probabilistic Mathematics, onde além desta públicação, constam outros 19 livros que exploram áreas da estatística.
O livro foi publicado (2ª ed) em 2006 e talvez seja por isso que os gráficos não façam uso da biblioteca ggplot e a manipulação dos dados não utilize dplyr ou algo do universo tidyverse.
A didática do livro é muito boa, os autores conseguiram explicar os conceitos estatísticos com clareza e os códigos usados foram bem comentados para facilitar o entendimento.</description>

      <description>The linear regression model is highly used on the prediction of continuous variables, where is one or more independent variables and one dependent one (the one that it seeks to test an hipothesis about its behavior). This is a pretty simple model to by executed and one of the firsts to be taught in econometric classes. Although its simplicity, in order to reach reliable results, some assumptions are needed, like the following:</description>
