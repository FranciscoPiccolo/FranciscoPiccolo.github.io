      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Francisco, an Economist that enjoy working with data and statistics. Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s why i&amp;rsquo;m working with Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse since 2015. This field allows me to code (mainly in SQL, R and Python), analyse data using statistics and communicate business research throughout reports and data viz. I try keep learning different tools and models to solve business problems and increase my capacity to generate insights from data in a productive way.</description>
