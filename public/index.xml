      <description>OverviewThis book is the tipical book reference for a given subject, and when the theme is Econometrics, this material is highly recommended for economics grad students. For its importance, in this post I’ll present a brief summary of each chapter and solve some exercises (because the book doesn’t present the answer for the problems). Also, I’ll release the datasets used on the problems on my github account.
The authors aimed to build a material that would serve all levels of students that want learn econometrics.</description>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique developed by John Tukey in 1960 that aims the following goals: formulate hipothesis, generate graphs e understand patterns on the data. All these goals envision to make people aware of insights that they hadn’t thought before. With this technique being created, also became alive the program language S, the predecessor of R.
The EDA is an activity frequently made by many different professionals, that have to handle with increasingly data volumes (structured and unstructured) to answer business questions in a fastly pace.</description>

      <description>OverviewEste livro faz parte de uma coleção da Universidade de Cambridge - Cambridge Series in Statistics and Probabilistic Mathematics, onde além desta públicação, constam outros 19 livros que exploram áreas da estatística.
O livro foi publicado (2ª ed) em 2006 e talvez seja por isso que os gráficos não façam uso da biblioteca ggplot e a manipulação dos dados não utilize dplyr ou algo do universo tidyverse.
A didática do livro é muito boa, os autores conseguiram explicar os conceitos estatísticos com clareza e os códigos usados foram bem comentados para facilitar o entendimento.</description>

      <description>Imigration is a central theme on political debates for presidential elections nowadays, creating a lot of controversies and also hope for many people. This social event is increasingly calling more attention, mainly after the Siria conflict and the weakness of the Venezuelan economy, perhaps it’s because it surpreended politicians that didn’t get ready earlier to obtain the benefits that migration flow can lead.
Because of this relevance about the theme, in November 2019 The Economist made a special report about imigration, with the goal of clarify the current situation and present success cases of countries that are obtaining advantages of the imigration flow.</description>

This is a pretty simple model to by executed and one of the firsts to be taught in econometric classes.
