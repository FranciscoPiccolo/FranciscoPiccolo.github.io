## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Função e comportamento gráfico

```{r}

a <- function(x){
  (2*(x^2))+1
}

b <- function(x){
  (4*(x^2))+5
}

df_1 <- data.frame(a=a(seq(1,10,by = 1)),b=seq(1,10,by = 1))
df_2 <- data.frame(b=b(seq(1,10,by = 1)),a=seq(1,10,by = 1))

ggplot()+
  geom_line(data=df_1,aes(x=b,y=a))
  geom_line(data=df_2,aes(x=a,y=b))
  
c <- function(e){
  e^-0.3
}

plot(c(seq(1,100,by = 1)))

log(-0.6931)

2.71^(0.0025*0.6931)

Limites:

1) Represente graficamente $\lim\limits_{\sin\theta\to0}\frac{\sin\theta}{\theta}$


```{r}
a <- function(x){
  sin(x)/x
}

df <- data.frame(
  a = a(c(-0.0001,-0.001,-0.01,-0.1,0.0001,0.001,0.1,0.9,1)),
  b = c(-0.0001,-0.001,-0.01,-0.1,0.0001,0.001,0.1,0.9,1))

df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=b,y=a))+
  geom_line()

Velocidade de uma partícula: 3t^²

```{r}
a <- function(h){
  (((3*(1+h))^2)-9)/(h)

plot(a(c(0.1,0.01,0.001,0.00001,0.0000001)),type = "l")
```



Gráfico de um carro sendo girigido a uma velocidade crescente:

```{r}
a <- function(x){
  0+1.2^x
}

plot(a(c(seq(1,10,by = 1))))
```


```{r}
a <- function(h){
  (((3+h)^3)-27)/(h)
}

df <- data.frame(
  a = a(c(-0.00001,-0.0001,-0.001,-0.01,-0.1,0.000001,0.00001,0.0001,0.001,0.01)),

)

df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=b,y=a))+
