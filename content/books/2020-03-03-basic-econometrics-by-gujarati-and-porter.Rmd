## **Overview**

This book is the tipical book reference for a given subject, and when the theme is Econometrics, this material is highly recommended for economics grad students. For its importance, in this post I'll present a brief summary of each chapter and solve some exercises (because the book doesn't present the answer for the problems). Also, I'll release the datasets used on the problems on my [github](https://github.com/FranciscoPiccolo) account.

The authors aimed to build a material that would serve all levels of students that want learn econometrics. The initial chapters describe the main assumptions of econometric models and simple regression equations and problems. All chapters are embedded with examples to illustrate the main findings. To beggin this summary, lets see what the authors say about the subject:

> "Econometry is the application of statistics in economic data".

> "Econometry is the quantiative analysis of economic phenomena".

## **Cap.1 The nature of regression analysis**

This chapter presents some foundations of regression analysis. First it's defined the concept and then its goals. Accordingly with the authors, regression is the study of the dependence of one variable in relation to one or more independent variables. 

Following, the authors indicate the difference between statistical relations and deterinistic relations, presenting some scenrios for each one. Also, it's explained the difference between regression and causality and between regression and correlation.

Now let's see some exercised presented in this chapter.

### **Exercises**

### **1.1) Bring the dataset from table 1.3 related to consumer price index to answer the following questions**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.3 <- read.table(file = paste(path,"tabela_1.3_IPC.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Random sample of the dataset
tbl_1.3[sample(nrow(tbl_1.3),10), ] %>% as.tibble()
```

### **a) With the dataset, generate the inflation rate for each country.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Inflation rate (1985 = 100)
cpi_index <- tbl_1.3 %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1985,2005))

cpi_index <- cpi_index[2,2:8]-cpi_index[1,2:8]

cpi_index %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **b) Graphically represent the inflation rate of each country.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.3 %>%
  tidyr::gather("campo", "valor", 2:8) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = valor, group = campo, color = campo))+
  geom_line()+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Anual inflation for selected countries",
       x = "",
       y = "")
```

### **1.7) The table 1.6 represents the budget used with advertising and the retention of impressions from customers, based in a survey with 4.000 people.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.6 <- read.table(file = paste(path,
                                   "tabela_1.6_publicidade.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ","
                      )

# Sample from the dataset
tbl_1.6[sample(nrow(tbl_1.6),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Present the relation between impressions and advertising expenditures.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.6 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = investment, y = impressions))+
  geom_point(color = graph_color)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              se = F, 
              lty = 20, 
              color = "dark orange")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Investment and Impressions relation",
       x = "Investment",
       y = "Impressions")
```

## **Cap.2 Regression analysis with two variables: Some basic ideas**

In this chapter the authors go a little deep on simple regression models, introducting the concept of **expected value of Y**. One of the key findings of this chapter is...

> "The essence of regression models is to supply conditions to explain the average value of the Y variable throughout one equation."

The authors also affirm that the linear regression model will try to estimate the **population regression function** using economic theories and sample date of the population being studied. With the sample data occur the creation of the regression model for this sample that will be a proxy for the population regression function. Thus, regression models have to deal with inferences and uncertainty.

Also, in this chapter the authors explain that the models of the book are linear on the independent variables (x1, x2, etc), but not on the parameters ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, etc). At the end of the chapter, the authors explain about the stochastic erros of the model, that represent all other variables that weren't included in the developed model.

### **Exercises**

### **2.14) Use the table 2.7 containing US job market data to answer the alternatives.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_2.7 <- read.table(file = paste(path,
                                   "tabela_2.7_labour_market.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Sample data
tbl_2.7[sample(nrow(tbl_2.7),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **c) Graphically represent the participation rate on men and women in relation to thei average earning per hour.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
women_df <- 
  tbl_2.7 %>% 
  select(share_women_work_force,avg_hourly_earning_women) %>% 
  transmute(
    share_work_force = share_women_work_force,
    avg_hourly_earning = avg_hourly_earning_women
  ) %>% 
  mutate(type = "women")

tbl_2.7 %>% 
  select(share_men_work_force,avg_hourly_earning_men) %>% 
  transmute(
    share_work_force = share_men_work_force,
    avg_hourly_earning = avg_hourly_earning_men
  ) %>% 
  mutate(type = "men") %>% 
  union_all(women_df) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=share_work_force,y=avg_hourly_earning,color=type))+
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Average hourly wage and participation rate",
       x = "Participation rate",
       y = "Hourly wage")
```

### **2.15) Use the table 2.8 with data about food expenses and total expenses from 55 houses in India to answer the following questions.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_2.8 <- read.table(file = paste(path,
                                   "tabela_2.8_despesa_india.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T,
                      dec = ",")

# Random sample
tbl_2.8[sample(nrow(tbl_2.8),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Represent the data drawing the food expenses in the Y axis and total expenses in the X axis and then plot the regression line.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_2.8 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total, y = alimento))+
  geom_point(color = graph_color, shape = 20)+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, color = "dark orange", lty = 2)+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Food expenditures and total expenditures",
       x = "Total expenditures",
       y = "Food expenditures")
```

## **Cap.3 Regression model with two variables: The estimation problem**

The goal of this chapter will be the estimation of the populational regression function using a regression model created from a sample data of the population. The authors indicate two possible methods for this task, (i) the ordinary least squares (OLS) and (ii) the maximum likelihood. Both methods lead to the same results but the first one is easier to apply.

As the focus of the chapter is about estimation, the authors explain the hipothesis that support the estimation when using the OLS method. They are summed up below:

* Independency of the X variables and the error term ($\mu$).

* The mean value of $\mu$ should be zero. This hipothesis subjectively afirm that there's not specification mistakes on the model.

* Homoscedasticity of $\mu$. In other words, there's constant variation of the $\mu$ term.

* There's no correlation between $\mu$ values of the model.

### **Exercises**

### **3.19) The following equation shows the relation between exchange rate and inflation rate for Canada and US in the period of 1985 to 2005.**

$$\widehat{Y_t} = 0.912 + 2.25X_t$$

Where:

$\widehat{Y_t}$ = Canadian Exchange Rate (DC/US$)

$X_t$ = US Inflation Rate/Canada Inflation Rate

### **a) Write the interpretation for this regression model.**

This regression model indicates that as US inflation rate is higher than Canadian inflation rate, the Canadian currency will appreciate, thus the denominator of the fraction $DC/US$ will be lower because inflation erodes the purchasing power of the currency. The r² of 44% indicates that ther're other variables that could support the model.

### **b) The positive value of X has economic foundations?** 

Yes, it does. As the inflation rate is higher in the US, the Canadian dolar will be traded by more US dolars.

### **3.20) The next table presents a dataset about hourly production index (X) and hourly real wages (Y) for the industrial sector and non agricultural sector, between 1960 and 2005**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 <- read.table(file = paste(path,"tabela_3.6_produtividade_e_salario.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")
```

### **a) Graphically represent separetely Y versus X for the two sectors of the economy.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 %>% 
  tidyr::gather("production","prod",2:3) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("wage","wag",2:3) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = prod, y = wag, color = production))+
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")+
  geom_smooth(aes(x = prod, y = wag), 
              method = "lm",
              se = F, 
              lty = 2, 
              color = "dark orange")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Production index and hourly wages",
       x = "Production",
       y = "Wage")
```

### **c) Create a regression model usgin OLS method for Y and X.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 %>% 
  tidyr::gather("production","X",2:3) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("wage","Y",2:3) -> df_tbl_3.6

summary(lm(Y~X, data = df_tbl_3.6))
```

### **3.22) The following dataset presents gold price, NYSE index and CPI index between 1974 to 2006. Use this dataset to answer the next questions.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.7 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_3.7_ouro_nyse_IPC.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Sample from dataset
tbl_3.7[sample(nrow(tbl_3.7),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Plot the gold price, NYSE index and CPI index in a dispersion graph.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.7 %>% 
  transmute(x = gold_price,
            y = nyse_index,
            z = ipc_index) -> df_test

x <- df_test$x
y <- df_test$y
z <- df_test$z
  
plot3D::scatter3D(x, y, z, 
                  colvar = NULL, 
                  add = FALSE, 
                  col = "blue", 
                  pch = 19, 
                  phi = 20, 
                  theta = 20, 
                  cex = .9, 
                  bty = "b2", 
                  expand = .9, 
                  col.grid = "darkblue", 
                  col.panel = "steelblue", 
                  colkey = T, 
                  main = "Table 3.7 data", 
                  xlab = "gold_price", 
                  ylab = "nyse_index", 
                  zlab = "ipc_index")
```

### **b) Suposing that an investment works as an inflation edge if its profitability follows the inflation rate, test the following regression models using the variables of the dataset.**

$$gold.price = \beta_1 + \beta_2 + CPI + \mu$$
$$NYSE.index = \beta_1 + \beta_2 + CPI + \mu$$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Adjusting the dataset to take the profitability of each asset
tbl_3.7 %>% 
  mutate(gold_price_var = round(gold_price/lag(gold_price, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1,
         nyse_index_var = round(nyse_index/lag(nyse_index, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1,
         ipc_index_var = round(ipc_index/lag(ipc_index, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(gold_price_var)) -> tbl_3.7_df_adj
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
g1 <- 
  tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = nyse_index_var), color = graph_color)+
  geom_abline(lty = 2, color = "dark orange", alpha = .7)+
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = nyse_index_var), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, color = "red", alpha = .8)+
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 8))+
  labs(title = "NYSE vs CPI",
       x = "IPC index variation",
       y = "NYSE index variation")

g2 <- 
  tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = gold_price_var), color = graph_color)+
  geom_abline(lty = 2, color = "dark orange", alpha = .7)+
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = gold_price_var), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x)+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, lty = 2, color = "red", alpha = .8)+
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 8))+
  labs(title = "Gold Price vs CPI",
       x = "IPC index variation",
       y = "Gold price variation")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1,g2,ncol = 2)
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Modelo 1, gold_price ~ ipc_index
tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  lm(formula = gold_price_var ~ ipc_index_var)
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Modelo 2, nyse_index ~ ipc_index
tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  lm(formula = nyse_index_var ~ ipc_index_var)
```

Apparently, gold price is a better asset to edge inflation rate than the NYSE index. Althought there're two outliers on the gold price data that are impacting the model.

## **Cap.4 Classical Normal Linear Regression Model**

In this chapter the authors gave attention to the classical normal linear regression model that introduces the concept of normal distrubutions of residuals. As was informed in previus chapter, the goal of the regression model is to estimate parameters ($\hat{\beta}$) for the populational parameter ($\beta$) and because it's an estimation based on samples, the result will vary on each model and the variation of ($\hat{\beta}$) will follow a particular distribution.

Knowing that $\hat{\beta}$ should follow a particular distribution, the most desired one is the normal distribution. To afirm that the parameter follows the normal distribution, the author prove algebrically that $\hat{\beta}$ is a linear function of the residuals $\mu$. Then, having the premise that $\mu$ is normally distributed, the premise that $\hat{\beta}$ is normally distributed will be attended. The premise of $\hat{\beta}$ and $\mu$ being normally distributed will allow inferences about the population's parameters using confident intervals and test of hypothesis, two techniques developed by classical statisticians.

## **Cap.5 Two variables regression model: The confidence interval and hypothesis test**

After explaining the premises of the classical linear regression model on the last chapter, the authors develop in this chapter the hole regression model to draw inferences about the population parameters being studied. Before they start the explanation, they indicate that the expected value of the sample parameter will be the true value of the populational parameter. Mathematically it means that $e(\hat{\beta}) = \beta$. Also, they indicate that the reliability of the parameters created by the regression model will be measured by the **standard error**, and this metric will support the development of the confidence interval and test of hypothesis.

After explaining this initial assumptions, the authors explain how to develop confidence intervals for the parameters and how to conduct the test of hypothesis.

**Confidence Intervals**

In this method, intervals are constructed by two distinct methods. The first is when the populational variance is known and the second is when it isn't known. For the first case, the **t distribution** is used, for the second, the **normal distribution** is used. In both cases, the interval range will be proportional to the standard error.

The following equation present this method:

$$\hat{\beta} +/- (z|t_\frac{\alpha}{2}  ep(\hat{\beta}))$$

**Hypothesis Test**

In this method, the researcher can use the confidence interval explained before or the test of significance that will create the p-value to allow the conclusion about the hypothesis.

### **Exercises**

### **5.3) Consult the regression model of the equation (3.7.3) to answer the following questions.**

$$\hat{Y} = 14.4773 + 0.0022X_i$$

$$ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 6.1523; ep(\hat{\beta_2}) = 0.00032; r² = 0.6023$$

### **a) The estimated coeficient is statistically significant at 5%? What is the Null hypothesis for this scenario?**

The significance of the intercept $\beta_1$ will be validated by testing the hypothesis that it is zero. Then we have H0: $\beta_1 = 0$ and H1: $\beta_1 \neq 0$. For this test we'll generate the **t-statistics** (from the student distribution, because the population variation is unknown) in order to calculate the p-value and make the conclusion about the Null hypothesis (reject H0 or fail to reject it).

**t-statistics** 

$$\frac{\hat{\beta_1}-\beta_1}{ep(\hat{\beta_1})}$$

$$\frac{14,47-0}{6.1523} = 2.35$$

Having the **t-statistics**, it's possible to calculate the **p-value**.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# p-value calculation in R
(1-pt(2.35, 36))*2
```

Using a significance level of 5% and 34 degrees of freedom, the p-value for this critical value of t is 0.02437, lower than the established limit. In this case, the Null hypothesis can be rejected and the intercept can be considered statistically significant for the model.

### **b) The coeficient for the slope is statistically significant at 5% of confidence? What is the Null hypothesis for this test?**

The same approach can be used for this question. The hypothesis are H0: $\beta_2 = 0$ e H1: $\beta_2 \neq 0$. The same equations can be used, adjusting the values of the variables.

**t-statistics** 

$$\frac{0.0022}{0.00032} = 6.88$$

This **t-statistics** will generate a pretty low **p-value**, thus the Null hypothesis can be rejected without concern and the conclusion that the parameter of the slope is statistically significant at 5% of confidence can be made.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# p-value using the t-statistics calculated before
(1-pt(6.88,36))*2
```

### **5.9) The table 5.5 present data about teachers' earnings and students' expenditures in 1985 for 50 US states. In order to verify the relation between earnings and expenditures, the following model was sugested.**

$$r = \beta_1+\beta_2\times g + \mu$$

Where:

r = teachers' earnings

g = students' expenditures

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_5.5 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_5.5_salario_medio_anual_e_despesa_por_aluno.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")

# Dataset sample
tbl_5.5[sample(nrow(tbl_5.5),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **b) Create a regression model to analyze the standard error and r².**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_5.5 %>%
  lm(formula = wage~expense) %>% 
  summary()
```

With the output, the following equations is generated:

$$\hat{r} = \hat{\beta_1}+\hat{\beta_2}\times g+\mu$$

$$\hat{r} = 12.13+0.003308\times g+\mu$$

### **d) Test if the true parameter of beta 2 is 3. Use a confidence interval for this task.**

For this scenario, we have: H0: $\beta_2 = 3$ and H1: $\beta_2 \neq 3$. The equation to build the limits is:

$$\hat{\beta_2} + t_\frac{\alpha}{2} \times ep(\hat{\beta_2})$$
Using the **t distribution** because population variance is unknown and $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ because is a two side test (i.e. H1: $\beta_2 \neq 3$).

To solve this equation, it's necessary to get the **critical t value** (not **t-statistics** in this case). This value is calculated with the significance level of [1-(5%/2)] and degrees of freedom of the model (49).

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Critical t value
qt(0.975, df = 49)
```

Using this value with the parameter value and its standard error, it's possible to build the interval.

$\hat{\beta_2} = 0.003308$

$ep(\hat{\beta_2}) = 0.0003117$

Critical t value = 2.009575

Then, the interval is (0.00268 e 0.00393). Allowing the rejection of the Null hypothesis. 

### **5.13) Return to the exercise 3.22 to use the dataset.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Dataset sample
tbl_3.7[sample(nrow(tbl_1.3),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```
### **b) The regression's residuals are normally distributed?**

Yes. The following graph will present the histogram of their values.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Extracting the residuals from the model
tbl_3.7 %>%
  lm(formula = ipc_index~gold_price) %>%
  residuals() %>% 
  data.frame(a = .) -> res_1
  
res_1 %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = a), fill = graph_color)+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Regression model's residuals distribution",
       subtitle = "IPC and gold price relation")
```


```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Extracting the residuals from the model
tbl_3.7 %>%
  lm(formula = ipc_index~nyse_index) %>%
  residuals() %>% 
  data.frame(a = .) -> res_2
  
res_2 %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = a), fill = graph_color)+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Regression model's residuals distribution",
       subtitle = "IPC and NYSE index relation")
```

### **c) In the gold price regression model, test the hypothesis that the second parameter is 1.**

The regression model generated a $\beta_2$ of 0.1693 with a standard error of 0.06624. These values generated a t statistics of 2.556 and a p-value of 0.0157, but considering the Null hypothesis of H0: $\beta_2 = 0$. To answer the question (H0: $\beta_2 = 1$), it's necessary to put these values on the equation below to recalculate the t statistics and the p-value:

$$t.value = \frac{|\hat{\beta_2} - \beta_2|}{SEM}$$

$$t.value = \frac{|0.1693 - 1|}{0.06624} = 12.54076$$

This value of t will generate a lower p-value, as seging below.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
(1-pt(12.54076, 31))*2
```

Then, the Null hypothesis H0: $\beta_2 = 1$ can be rejected, allowing the conclusion that Gold Price is not a perfect edge asset for the inflation rate.

## **Cap.6 Extensions for the Linear Regression Models of two Variables**

In this chapter the authors present some additional regression models that will be more appropriated in some circunstances. These models are different, but the premise of linearity of parameters is unbroken.

The first model is the **regression model that pass by the origin** that has the form:

$$Y_i = \beta_2 X_i + \mu_i$$
This model is recommended when the theory behind it indicates that there's no need for a intercept. Without the theory to indicate it, the authors recommend to always maintain the intercept and let the statistics inform if it will be relevant.

Continuing, the authors explain about scales and unities on the models, regarding the difference that can exist in scales between the dependent variables and Y. They show that the conclusion won't change because these differences, but some algebric manipulations will be need. Also, they presented the standard variables on the regression model, used to analyze the impact of each independent variable on Y and obviously indicated to regression models with multiple variables. The standard variable has the form:

$$Y* = \frac{Y_j - \bar{Y}}{S_Y}$$

$$X* = \frac{X_j - \bar{X}}{S_X}$$

The next model presented is the logarithmic regression models, like log-log, lin-log and log-lin. And the last model presented is the reciprocal model, that has the following form:

$$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 (\frac{1}{X}) + \mu$$

### **Exercises**

### **6.2 The following regressions were obtained from a dataset that has Y as Texaco's monthly returns and X as market's monthly return, both in percentual.**

**(i)** $\hat{Y} = 0.00681 + 0.75815 X_t$  

$ep(\hat{\beta_0}) = 0.02596$; $ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 0.27009$

p-value: $\hat{\beta_0} = 0.7984$; $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.0186$

r² = 44.06%

**(ii)** $\hat{Y} = 0.76214 X_t$  

$ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 0.265799$

p-value: $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.0131$

r² = 43.68%

### **f) The normality Jarque-Beta statistics is 1.1167 for the first model and 1.1170 for the second model. What conclusions can be made from this values?**

When the result of this test is far from zero, it indicates that the data isn't normally distributed. Then, the first model with lower jarque-bera value has it's residuals closer to a normal distribution than the second model. The Null hypothesis of this test is that residuals are normally distributed, thus **H0: JB = 0** and **H1: JB > 0**. 

### **6.14 Using the table 6.7, adjust the following model and obtain the regression statistics of it.**

$$\frac{100}{100 - Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2(\frac{1}{X_i})$$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
df <- 
  data.frame(y = c(86,79,76,69,65,62,52,51,51,48),
             x = c(3,7,12,17,25,35,45,55,70,120))

df %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Reciprocal regression model")

# Gerando o modelo de regressão recíproco
df %>% 
  lm(formula = "100/(100-y) ~ I(1/x)") %>% 
  summary()
```

Given the regression output, Y will approach the value of 51.64 as the X value increases.

### **The table 6.8 presents data about investment and saving for 21 countries. This values are an average obtained from 1960 to 1974.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.8 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_6.8_investment_and_saving.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")

# Dataset sample
tbl_6.8[sample(nrow(tbl_6.8),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Graphically represent the relation between investment and saving**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = saving, y = investment), shape = 20)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Investment and Saving relation")
```

### **c) Develop a regression model using a lin-lin and a log-log model approach.**

$$Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_i + \mu_i$$
Where:

$Y_i = investment$

$X_i = saving$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Lin-lin model
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  lm(formula = investment ~ saving) %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Log-log model
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  lm(formula = log(investment) ~ log(saving)) %>% 
  summary()
```

### **d) How would you interpret the slope coeficient in the lin-lin model? And on the log-log model? There're any differences in the interpretation?**

A: The lin-lin model has the coeficient of 1.04772, meaning that in increase in 1 pp in saving would generate an increase of 1.04772 pp in investment. On the other hand, in the log-log model, the coeficient is 1.06308, meaning that an 1% increase in saving would cause and 1.06308% increase in investment. There's a difference in interpretation, because the first model is about changing percentual points and the second is about percentual variation.

### **Cap.7 Multiple Regression Analysis: The Estimation Problem**

The authors in this chapter explain how multiple regression have to be analyzed. They start presenting the hypothesis of this model, that are the same of simple regression models and then they explain that the coeficients of the model will measure the effect on the mean value of Y considering the other variables constant.

This consideration is made by removing the effect of the variation in one independent variable on the other (X1 and X2). Multiple regression models will generate the R² metric, that is different from the r², because it'll represent the proportion of Y that is explained by all other independente variables of the model (X1, X2, X3...).

Then, the author continue explaining the impact thar multiple regression models can suffer by specification errors in the design of the model. In this case, the error would be a missing independent variable.

Also, the author shows that in a multiple regression model, you'll have an Adjusted R² that will inform the same information of R² but considering the amount of variables including in the model. The Adjusted R² in this case, penalizes the inclusion of two many independente variables. At the end, they explain that in regression models, it's not relevant to seek a high Adjusted R², because the goal is to make reliable estimation of the populational parameters $\beta$ in order to make predictions.

### **Exercises**

### **7.1 Consider the table 7.5 below:**

```{r, echo = F}
data.frame(y = c(1,2,8),
           x_2 = c(1,2,3),
           x_3 = c(2,1,-3))
```

Build the following models:

$Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X_2 + \mu$

$Y = \lambda_1 + \lambda_3 X_3 + \mu$

$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \mu$

Verify if $\alpha_2 = \beta_2$, $\lambda_3 = \beta_3$.

A: Building the models.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
df <- data.frame(y = c(1,3,8),
                 x_2 = c(1,2,3),
                 x_3 = c(2,1,-3))

# First model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_2) %>% 
  summary()

# Second model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_3) %>% 
  summary()

# Third model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_2 + x_3) %>% 
  summary()
```

Then, after running the models in R, we have:

$Y = -3 + 3.5 X_2 + \mu$

$Y = 4 - 1.3571X_3 + \mu$

$Y = 2 + 1 X_2 - 1 X_3 + \mu$

With $\alpha_2 = 3.5$ and $\beta_2 = 1$; $\lambda_3 = -1.3571$ and $\beta_3 = -1$. These differences indicate that the independent variables have correlation between then, thus the coeficients diverge when putting together and when putther separatelly on the models. 

### **Cap.8 Multple Regression Analysis: The Inference Problem**

In this chapter the author record the reader that OLS method to develop regression models doen't make any assumption about the error distribution $\mu$ and the OLS would be fine if the goal is to make point estimation of the parameters of the model. But when the goal is to make estimations about the populational parameters, the normality of $\mu$ assumption will be required.

After, they present multiple hypothesis that can be tested in a multiple regression model, like:

1) Test hypothesis about one coeficient of the model (similar to Simple Regression Models).

2) Test the general significance of the model. In other words, test all the parameters ($\beta$) of the model.

3) Test if two or more parameters are equal.

4) Test if parameters make sense given a particular theory behind the model.

5) Test the model stability given different data samples or different periods.

In this chapter the author gave special attention to the F statistics. That is a metric that indicates the relevance of the paramters choosen for the regression model. Also, they presented the relation between F statistics and R².

Then, to end the chapter, they presented some discussion about when it is necessary to add new variables on a multiple regression model.
