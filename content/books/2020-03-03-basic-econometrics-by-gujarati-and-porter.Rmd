## **Overview**

This book is the tipical book reference for a given subject, and when the theme is Econometrics, this material is highly recommended for economy grad students. For its importance, in this post I'll present a brief summary of each chapter and solve some exercises (because the book doesn't present the answer for the problems). Also, I'll release the datasets used on the problems on my [github](https://github.com/FranciscoPiccolo/franciscopiccolo.github.io/tree/master/datasets/livro-econometria-basica-gujarati) account. To beggin this summary, lets see what the authors say about the subject:

> "Econometry is the application of statistics in economic data".

> "Econometry is the quantiative analysis of economic phenomena".

## **Cap.1 The nature of regression analysis**

This chapter presents some foundations of regression analysis. First it's defined the concept and then its goals. Accordingly with the authors, regression is the study of the dependence of one variable in relation to one or more independent variables. 

Following, the authors indicate the difference between statistical relations and deterministic relations, presenting some scenarios for each one. Also, it's explained the difference between regression and causality and between regression and correlation.

Now let's see some problems presented in this chapter.

### **Exercises**

### **1.1) Bring the dataset from table 1.3 related to consumer price index to answer the following questions.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.3 <- read.table(file = paste(path,"tabela_1.3_IPC.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Random sample of the dataset
tbl_1.3[sample(nrow(tbl_1.3),5), ] %>% as.tibble()
```

### **b) Graphically represent the inflation rate of each country.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.3 %>%
  tidyr::gather("campo", "valor", 2:8) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = valor, group = campo, color = campo),
            size = 1)+
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Anual inflation for selected countries",
       x = "",
       y = "")
```

### **1.7) The table 1.6 represents the budget used with advertising and the retention of impressions from customers, based in a survey with 4.000 people.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.6 <- read.table(file = paste(path,
                                   "tabela_1.6_advertising.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = ";",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ","
                      )

# Sample from the dataset
tbl_1.6[sample(nrow(tbl_1.6),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Present the relation between impressions and advertising expenditures.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_1.6 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = investment, y = impressions))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = investment, y = impressions),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = F,
              lty = 2,
              color = "dark orange")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Investment and Impressions relation",
       x = "Investment",
       y = "Impressions")
```

## **Cap.2 Regression analysis with two variables: Some basic ideas**

In this chapter the authors go a little deep on simple regression models, introducing the concept of **expected value of Y**. One of the key findings of this chapter is...

> "The essence of regression models is to supply conditions to explain the average value of the Y variable throughout one equation."

The authors also affirm that the linear regression model will try to estimate the **population regression function** using economic theories and sample date of the population being studied. With the sample data occur the creation of the regression model for this sample that will be a proxy for the population regression function. Thus, regression models have to deal with inferences and uncertainty.

Also, in this chapter the authors explain that the models of the book are linear on the independent variables (x1, x2, etc), but not on the parameters ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, etc). At the end of the chapter, the authors explain about the stochastic erros of the model, that represent all other variables that weren't included in the developed model.

### **Exercises**

### **2.15) Use the table 2.8 with data about food expenses and total expenses from 55 houses in India to answer the following questions.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_2.8 <- read.table(file = paste(path,
                                   "tabela_2.8_expenses_in_india.txt",
                                   sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T,
                      dec = ",")

# Random sample
tbl_2.8[sample(nrow(tbl_2.8),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Represent the data drawing the food expenses in the Y axis and total expenses in the X axis and then plot the regression line.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_2.8 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = total, y = food))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = total, y = food),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = F,
              lty = 2,
              color = "dark orange")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Food expenditures and total expenditures",
       x = "Total expenditures",
       y = "Food expenditures")
```

## **Cap.3 Regression model with two variables: The estimation problem**

The goal of this chapter will be the estimation of the populational regression function using a regression model created from a sample data of the population. The authors indicate two possible methods for this task, (i) the ordinary least squares (OLS) and (ii) the maximum likelihood. Both methods lead to the same results but the first one is easier to apply.

As the focus of the chapter is about estimation, the authors explain the hipothesis that support the estimation when using the OLS method. They are summed up below:

* Independency of the X variables and the error term ($\mu$).

* The mean value of $\mu$ should be zero. This hipothesis subjectively afirm that there's not specification mistakes on the model.

* Homoscedasticity of $\mu$. In other words, there's constant variation of the $\mu$ term.

* There's no correlation between $\mu$ values of the model.

### **Exercises**

### **3.19) The following equation shows the relation between exchange rate and inflation rate for Canada and US in the period of 1985 to 2005.**

$$\widehat{Y_t} = 0.912 + 2.25X_t$$

Where:

$\widehat{Y_t}$ = Canadian Exchange Rate (DC/US$)

$X_t$ = US Inflation Rate/Canada Inflation Rate

### **a) Write the interpretation for this regression model.**

This regression model indicates that as US inflation rate is higher than Canadian inflation rate, the Canadian currency will appreciate, thus the denominator of the fraction $DC/US$ will be lower because inflation erodes the purchasing power of the currency. The rÂ² of 44% indicates that ther're other variables that could support the model.

### **b) The positive value of X has economic foundations?** 

Yes, it does. As the inflation rate is higher in the US, the Canadian dolar will be traded by more US dolars.

### **3.20) The next table presents a dataset about hourly production index (X) and hourly real wages (Y) for the industrial sector and non agricultural sector, between 1960 and 2005**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 <- read.table(file = paste(path,"tabela_3.6_wage_and_productivity.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Random sample
tbl_3.6[sample(nrow(tbl_3.6),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Graphically represent separetely Y versus X for the two sectors of the economy.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 %>% 
  tidyr::gather("production","prod",2:3) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("wage","wag",2:3) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = prod, y = wag, color = production))+
  scale_color_brewer(type = "qual")+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = prod, y = wag),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = F, 
              lty = 2, 
              color = "dark orange")+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Production index and hourly wages",
       x = "Production",
       y = "Wage")
```

### **c) Create a regression model usgin OLS method.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.6 %>% 
  tidyr::gather("production","X",2:3) %>% 
  tidyr::gather("wage","Y",2:3) -> df_tbl_3.6

summary(lm(Y~X, data = df_tbl_3.6))
```

### **3.22) The following dataset presents gold price, NYSE index and CPI index between 1974 to 2006. Use this dataset to answer the next questions.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.7 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_3.7_ouro_nyse_IPC.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Sample from dataset
tbl_3.7[sample(nrow(tbl_3.7),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Plot the gold price, NYSE index and CPI index in a dispersion graph.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.7 %>% 
  transmute(x = gold_price,
            y = nyse_index,
            z = ipc_index) -> df_test

x <- df_test$x
y <- df_test$y
z <- df_test$z
  
plot3D::scatter3D(x, y, z, 
                  colvar = NULL, 
                  add = FALSE, 
                  col = "blue", 
                  pch = 19, 
                  phi = 20, 
                  theta = 20, 
                  cex = .9, 
                  bty = "b2", 
                  expand = .9, 
                  col.grid = "darkblue", 
                  col.panel = "steelblue", 
                  colkey = T, 
                  main = "Table 3.7 data", 
                  xlab = "gold_price", 
                  ylab = "nyse_index", 
                  zlab = "ipc_index")
```

### **b) Suposing that an investment works as an inflation edge if its profitability follows the inflation rate, test the following regression models using the variables of the dataset.**

$$gold.price = \beta_1 + \beta_2 + CPI + \mu$$
$$NYSE.index = \beta_1 + \beta_2 + CPI + \mu$$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Adjusting the dataset to take the profitability of each asset
tbl_3.7 %>% 
  mutate(gold_price_var = round(gold_price/lag(gold_price, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1,
         nyse_index_var = round(nyse_index/lag(nyse_index, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1,
         ipc_index_var = round(ipc_index/lag(ipc_index, 1, default = NA), digits = 8)-1) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(gold_price_var)) -> tbl_3.7_df_adj
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
g1 <- 
  tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = nyse_index_var), color = "dark orange")+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = nyse_index_var),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = F,
              lty = 2,
              color = "dark orange")+
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 8))+
  labs(title = "NYSE vs CPI",
       x = "CPI index variation",
       y = "NYSE index variation")

g2 <- 
  tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = gold_price_var), color = "dark orange")+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = ipc_index_var, y = gold_price_var),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = F,
              lty = 2,
              color = "dark orange")+
  expand_limits(x = 0, y = 0)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  theme(title = element_text(size = 8))+
  labs(title = "Gold Price vs CPI",
       x = "CPI index variation",
       y = "Gold price variation")

gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1,g2,ncol = 2)
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Modelo 1, gold_price ~ ipc_index
tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  lm(formula = gold_price_var ~ ipc_index_var) %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Modelo 2, nyse_index ~ ipc_index
tbl_3.7_df_adj %>% 
  lm(formula = nyse_index_var ~ ipc_index_var) %>% 
  summary()
```

Apparently, gold price is a better asset to edge inflation rate than the NYSE index. Althought there're two outliers on the gold price data that are impacting the model.

## **Cap.4 Classical Normal Linear Regression Model**

In this chapter the authors gave attention to the classical normal linear regression model that introduces the concept of normal distrubutions of residuals. As was informed in previus chapter, the goal of the regression model is to estimate parameters ($\hat{\beta}$) for the populational parameter ($\beta$) and because it's an estimation based on samples, the result will vary on each model and the variation of ($\hat{\beta}$) will follow a particular distribution.

Knowing that $\hat{\beta}$ should follow a particular distribution, the most desired one is the normal distribution. To afirm that the parameter follows the normal distribution, the author prove algebrically that $\hat{\beta}$ is a linear function of the residuals $\mu$. Then, having the premise that $\mu$ is normally distributed, the premise that $\hat{\beta}$ is normally distributed will be attended. The premise of $\hat{\beta}$ and $\mu$ being normally distributed will allow inferences about the population's parameters using confident intervals and test of hypothesis, two techniques developed by classical statisticians.

## **Cap.5 Two variables regression model: The confidence interval and hypothesis test**

After explaining the premises of the classical linear regression model on the last chapter, the authors develop in this chapter the hole regression model to draw inferences about the population parameters being studied. Before they start the explanation, they indicate that the expected value of the sample parameter will be the true value of the populational parameter. Mathematically it means that $e(\hat{\beta}) = \beta$. Also, they indicate that the reliability of the parameters created by the regression model will be measured by the **standard error**, and this metric will support the development of the confidence interval and test of hypothesis.

After explaining this initial assumptions, the authors explain how to develop confidence intervals for the parameters and how to conduct the test of hypothesis.

**Confidence Intervals**

In this method, intervals are constructed by two distinct methods. The first is when the populational variance is known and the second is when it isn't known. For the first case, the **t distribution** is used, for the second, the **normal distribution** is used. In both cases, the interval range will be proportional to the standard error.

The following equation present this method:

$$\hat{\beta} +/- (z|t_\frac{\alpha}{2}  ep(\hat{\beta}))$$

**Hypothesis Test**

In this method, the researcher can use the confidence interval explained before or the test of significance that will create the p-value to allow the conclusion about the hypothesis.

### **Exercises**

### **5.3) Consult the regression model of the equation (3.7.3) to answer the following questions.**

$$\hat{Y} = 14.4773 + 0.0022X_i$$

$$ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 6.1523; ep(\hat{\beta_2}) = 0.00032; rÂ² = 0.6023$$

### **a) The estimated coeficient is statistically significant at 5%? What is the Null hypothesis for this scenario?**

The significance of the intercept $\beta_1$ will be validated by testing the hypothesis that it is zero. Then we have H0: $\beta_1 = 0$ and H1: $\beta_1 \neq 0$. For this test we'll generate the **t-statistics** (from the student distribution, because the population variation is unknown) in order to calculate the p-value and make the conclusion about the Null hypothesis (reject H0 or fail to reject it).

**t-statistics** 

$$\frac{\hat{\beta_1}-\beta_1}{ep(\hat{\beta_1})}$$

$$\frac{14,47-0}{6.1523} = 2.35$$

Having the **t-statistics**, it's possible to calculate the **p-value**. For this, we have to use the distribution function for the t distribution, that will ask for the t-statistics and degrees of freedom. This function will show the area under de curve that would contain this t-statistics given this degree of freedom and when we make 1 minus this area under de curve and multiply the result by 2 (because it's a bicaudal test), we generate the p-value.

The area under the curve for the t distribution with a t-statistics of 2.35 and 34 df is 0.9876. In other words, 98.76% probability of having a value inside the range (-2.35 to 2.35) given 34 df.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
pt(2.35, 34)
```

The p-value will be the probability of having a value outside this range, in this case 1-0.9876. Also, as is a bicaudal test (because H1 is $\beta_1\neq 0$) it's necessary to multiply the value by 2. Then, we have:

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# p-value calculation in R
(1-pt(2.35, 34))*2
```

Concluding, with a p-value of 2.437% it's possible to reject H0 because the significance level as of 5%. In other words the intercept of the model is statistically significant at 5% of significance level.

### **b) The slope is statistically significant at 5% of confidence level? What is the Null hypothesis for this test?**

The same approach can be used for this question. The hypothesis are H0: $\beta_2 = 0$ e H1: $\beta_2 \neq 0$. The same equations can be used, adjusting the values of the variables.

**t-statistics** 

$$\frac{0.0022}{0.00032} = 6.88$$

This **t-statistics** will generate a pretty low **p-value**, thus the Null hypothesis can be rejected without concern and the conclusion that the parameter of the slope is statistically significant at 5% of confidence can be made.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# p-value using the t-statistics calculated before
(1-pt(6.88,36))*2
```

### **5.9) The table 5.5 present data about teachers' earnings and students' expenditures in 1985 for 50 US states. In order to verify the relation between earnings and expenditures, the following model was sugested.**

$$r = \beta_1+\beta_2\times g + \mu$$

Where:

r = teachers' earnings

g = students' expenditures

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_5.5 <- 
  read.table(file = paste(path,"tabela_5.5_wage_and_college_expenditures.txt", sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")

# Dataset sample
tbl_5.5[sample(nrow(tbl_5.5),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **b) Create a regression model to analyze the standard error and rÂ².**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_5.5 %>%
  lm(formula = wage~expense) %>% 
  summary()
```

With the output, the following equations is generated:

$$\hat{r} = \hat{\beta_1}+\hat{\beta_2}\times g+\mu$$

$$\hat{r} = 12.13+0.003308\times g+\mu$$

### **d) Test if the true parameter of beta 2 is 3. Use a confidence interval for this task.**

For this scenario, we have: H0: $\beta_2 = 3$ and H1: $\beta_2 \neq 3$. The equation to build the limits is:

$$\hat{\beta_2} +/- t_\frac{\alpha}{2} \times ep(\hat{\beta_2})$$
Using the **t distribution** because population variance is unknown and $\frac{\alpha}{2}$ because is a two side test (i.e. H1: $\beta_2 \neq 3$).

To solve this equation, it's necessary to get the **critical t value** (not **t-statistics** in this case). This value is calculated with the significance level of [1-(5%/2)] and degrees of freedom of the model (49).

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Critical t value
qt(0.975, df = 49)
```

Using this value with the parameter value and its standard error, it's possible to build the interval.

$\hat{\beta_2} = 0.003308$

$ep(\hat{\beta_2}) = 0.0003117$

Critical t value = 2.009575

$$\hat{\beta_2} +/- t_\frac{\alpha}{2} \times ep(\hat{\beta_2})$$

$$0.003308 +/- 2.009575 \times 0.0003117$$

Then, the interval is (0.00268 e 0.00393). Allowing the rejection of the Null hypothesis. 

### **5.13) Return to the exercise 3.22 to use the dataset.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Dataset sample
tbl_3.7[sample(nrow(tbl_1.3),10), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **b) The regression's residuals are normally distributed?**

Yes. The following graph will present the histogram of their values.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Extracting the residuals from the model
tbl_3.7 %>%
  lm(formula = ipc_index~gold_price) %>%
  residuals() %>% 
  data.frame(a = .) -> res_1

### **c) In the gold price regression model, test the hypothesis that the second parameter is 1.**

The regression model generated a $\beta_2$ of 0.1693 with a standard error of 0.06624. These values generated a t statistics of 2.556 and a p-value of 0.0157, but considering the Null hypothesis of H0: $\beta_2 = 0$. To answer the question (H0: $\beta_2 = 1$), it's necessary to put these values on the equation below to recalculate the t statistics and the p-value:

$$t.value = \frac{|\hat{\beta_2} - \beta_2|}{SEM}$$

$$t.value = \frac{|0.1693 - 1|}{0.06624} = 12.54076$$

This value of t will generate a lower p-value, as seging below.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
(1-pt(12.54076, 31))*2
```

Then, the Null hypothesis H0: $\beta_2 = 1$ can be rejected, allowing the conclusion that Gold Price is not a perfect edge asset for the inflation rate.

## **Cap.6 Extensions for the Linear Regression Models of two Variables**

In this chapter the authors present some additional regression models that will be more appropriated in some circunstances. These models are different, but the premise of linearity of parameters is unbroken.

The first model is the **regression model that pass by the origin** that has the form:

$$Y_i = \beta_2 X_i + \mu_i$$
This model is recommended when the theory behind it indicates that there's no need for a intercept. Without the theory to indicate it, the authors recommend to always maintain the intercept and let the statistics inform if it will be relevant.

Continuing, the authors explain about scales and unities on the models, regarding the difference that can exist in scales between the dependent variables and Y. They show that the conclusion won't change because these differences, but some algebric manipulations will be need. Also, they presented the standard variables on the regression model, used to analyze the impact of each independent variable on Y and obviously indicated to regression models with multiple variables. The standard variable has the form:

$$Y* = \frac{Y_j - \bar{Y}}{S_Y}$$

$$X* = \frac{X_j - \bar{X}}{S_X}$$

The next model presented is the logarithmic regression models, like log-log, lin-log and log-lin. And the last model presented is the reciprocal model, that has the following form:

$$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 (\frac{1}{X}) + \mu$$

### **Exercises**

### **6.2 The following regressions were obtained from a dataset that has Y as Texaco's monthly returns and X as market's monthly return, both in percentual.**

**(i)** $\hat{Y} = 0.00681 + 0.75815 X_t$  

$ep(\hat{\beta_0}) = 0.02596$; $ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 0.27009$

p-value: $\hat{\beta_0} = 0.7984$; $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.0186$

rÂ² = 44.06%

**(ii)** $\hat{Y} = 0.76214 X_t$  

$ep(\hat{\beta_1}) = 0.265799$

p-value: $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.0131$

rÂ² = 43.68%

### **f) The normality Jarque-Beta statistics is 1.1167 for the first model and 1.1170 for the second model. What conclusions can be made from this values?**

**A:** When the result of this test is far from zero, it indicates that the data isn't normally distributed. Then, the first model with lower jarque-bera value has it's residuals closer to a normal distribution than the second model. The Null hypothesis of this test is that residuals are normally distributed, thus **H0: JB = 0** and **H1: JB > 0**. 

### **6.14 Using the table 6.7, adjust the following model and obtain the regression statistics of it.**

$$\frac{100}{100 - Y_i} = \beta_1 + \beta_2(\frac{1}{X_i})$$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
df <- 
  data.frame(y = c(86,79,76,69,65,62,52,51,51,48),
             x = c(3,7,12,17,25,35,45,55,70,120))

df %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Reciprocal regression model")

# Gerando o modelo de regressÃ£o recÃ­proco
df %>% 
  lm(formula = "100/(100-y) ~ I(1/x)") %>% 
  summary()
```

**A:** Given the regression output, Y will approach the value of 51.64 as the X value increases.

### **6.15) The table 6.8 presents data about investment and saving for 21 countries. This values are an average obtained from 1960 to 1974.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.8 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_6.8_investment_and_saving.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")

# Dataset sample
tbl_6.8[sample(nrow(tbl_6.8),5), ] %>% 
  as.tibble()
```

### **a) Graphically represent the relation between investment and saving**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = saving, y = investment), shape = 20)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Investment and Saving relation")
```

### **c) Develop a regression model using a lin-lin and a log-log model approach.**

$$Y_i = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_i + \mu_i$$
Where:

$Y_i = investment$

$X_i = saving$

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Lin-lin model
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  lm(formula = investment ~ saving) %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Log-log model
tbl_6.8 %>% 
  lm(formula = log(investment) ~ log(saving)) %>% 
  summary()
```

### **d) How would you interpret the slope coeficient in the lin-lin model? And on the log-log model? There're any differences in the interpretation?**

**A:** The lin-lin model has the coeficient of 1.04772, meaning that in increase in 1 pp in saving would generate an increase of 1.04772 pp in investment. On the other hand, in the log-log model, the coeficient is 1.06308, meaning that an 1% increase in saving would cause and 1.06308% increase in investment. There's a difference in interpretation, because the first model is about changing percentual points and the second is about percentual variation.

### **6.19) The table 6.10 presents data about total consumption and advertising expendes for 29 product categories in UK.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.10 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_6.10_advertising_and_total_expenditures.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = " ",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")
```


### **a) Which regression model would better represent the data?**

**A:** In order to answer this question, it's better to try different regression models and visualize graphically which of them fit better on the data, taking care to not overfit.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.10 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = advertising, y = consumo))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = advertising, y = consumo),
              formula = y ~ x,
              method = "lm",
              se = F)+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = advertising, y = consumo),
            formula = "y ~ I(x^0.5)",
            method = "lm",
            se = F,
            color = "red")
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_6.10 %>% 
  lm(formula = "consumo ~ I(advertising^.5)") %>% 
  summary()

tbl_6.10 %>% 
  lm(formula = "consumo ~ advertising") %>% 
  summary()
```

It seems that the linear regression model fits better the data, because it generated a higher RÂ² and a lower p-value for the slope.

### **6.20) Recall the 3.3 example from chapter 3 to answer the following questions:**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.3 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_3.3_telefonia_movel_e_computadores.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = ";",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ",")

# Dataset sample
tbl_3.3[sample(nrow(tbl_3.3),10), ]
```

### **a) Graphically represent cellphone demand in relation to per capita income adjusted by PPP.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.3 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cellphone, y = per_capita_income))+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Cellphone vs Per capital income")
```

### **b) Graphically represent cellphone demand in relation to per capita income, both adjusted by logarithms.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.3 %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cellphone, y = per_capita_income))+
  scale_y_log10()+
  scale_x_log10()+
  theme_graph()+
  labs(title = "Cellphone vs Per capita income, log adjusted")
```

### **d) Analysing these two graphs, do you believe that a log-log model can fit better the data? Develop the regression model for a log-log method.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.3 %>% 
  lm(formula = "log(cellphone) ~ log(per_capita_income)") %>% 
  summary()
```

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_3.3 %>% 
  lm(formula = "cellphone ~ per_capita_income") %>% 
  summary()
```

**A:** The lin-lin model generated a slope with a lower p-value and a higher rÂ². Thus I would prefer this model instead of the log-log model.

### **Cap.7 Multiple Regression Analysis: The Estimation Problem**

The authors in this chapter explain how multiple regression have to be analyzed. They start presenting the hypothesis of this model, that are the same of simple regression models and then they explain that the coeficients of the model will measure the effect on the mean value of Y considering the other variables constant.

This consideration is made by removing the effect of the variation in one independent variable on the other (X1 and X2). Multiple regression models will generate the RÂ² metric, that is different from the rÂ², because it'll represent the proportion of Y that is explained by all other independente variables of the model (X1, X2, X3...).

Then, the author continue explaining the impact thar multiple regression models can suffer by specification errors in the design of the model. In this case, the error would be a missing independent variable.

Also, the author shows that in a multiple regression model, you'll have an Adjusted RÂ² that will inform the same information of RÂ² but considering the amount of variables including in the model. The Adjusted RÂ² in this case, penalizes the inclusion of two many independente variables. At the end, they explain that in regression models, it's not relevant to seek a high Adjusted RÂ², because the goal is to make reliable estimation of the populational parameters $\beta$ in order to make predictions.

### **Exercises**

### **7.1 Consider the table 7.5 below:**

```{r, echo = F}
data.frame(y = c(1,2,8),
           x_2 = c(1,2,3),
           x_3 = c(2,1,-3))
```

Build the following models:

$Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X_2 + \mu$

$Y = \lambda_1 + \lambda_3 X_3 + \mu$

$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \mu$

Verify if $\alpha_2 = \beta_2$, $\lambda_3 = \beta_3$.

**A:** Building the models.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
df <- data.frame(y = c(1,3,8),
                 x_2 = c(1,2,3),
                 x_3 = c(2,1,-3))

# First model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_2) %>% 
  summary()

# Second model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_3) %>% 
  summary()

# Third model
df %>% 
  lm(formula = y ~ x_2 + x_3) %>% 
  summary()
```

Then, after running the models in R, we have:

$Y = -3 + 3.5 X_2 + \mu$

$Y = 4 - 1.3571X_3 + \mu$

$Y = 2 + 1 X_2 - 1 X_3 + \mu$

With $\alpha_2 = 3.5$ and $\beta_2 = 1$; $\lambda_3 = -1.3571$ and $\beta_3 = -1$. These differences indicate that the independent variables have correlation between then, thus the coeficients diverge when putting together and when putther separatelly on the models.

### **7.13) Suposing that you have the following equations:**

$$Y = \alpha + \alpha_2 X + \mu$$
$$Z = \beta + \beta_2 X + \mu$$
Onde Y = consumo, Z = poupanÃ§a e X = (Y + Z).

### **a) What is the relation between alpha 2 and beta 2? Show your calculus.**

**A:** The slope of the models summed is 1 and their standard error is equal. Following is a random dataset to exemplify this situation.

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
# Random dataset
df <- data.frame(y = rnorm(100, 10, 3),
           z = rnorm(100, 25, 5))

g1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(x = y + z) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm")+
  theme_graph()

g2 <- df %>% 
  mutate(x = y + z) %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = z))+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = x, y = z),
              formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm")+
  theme_graph()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1,g2, ncol = 2)
```

Creating the regression model for the two variables (y and z).

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
df %>% 
  mutate(x = y + z) %>% 
  lm(formula = "y ~ x") %>% 
  summary()

df %>% 
  mutate(x = y + z) %>% 
  lm(formula = "z ~ x") %>% 
  summary()
```

### **c) It's possible to compare RÂ² of both models?**

**A:** No, because Y and Z can have different weights on X, thus the RÂ² would include this difference and preclude this comparisson.

### **7.6) The table 7.6 presents roses demand by quarter.**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_7.6 <- read.table(file = 
                      paste(path,"tabela_7.6_flower_demand_in_detroit.txt",sep = ""),
                      sep = ";",
                      header = T, 
                      dec = ".")

# Dataset sample
tbl_7.6[sample(nrow(tbl_7.6),5), ]
```

In this table we have **y = sold roses**, **x2 = average rose price**, **x3 = average clove price**, **x4 = average family income available** and **x5 = trend variable**.

Consider the following demand functions:

$$Y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 X_2 + \alpha_3 X_3 + \alpha_4 X_4 + \alpha_5 X_5 + \mu$$

$$ln(Y) = \beta_1 + \beta_2 ln(X_2) + \beta_3 ln(X_3) + \beta_4 ln(X_4) + \beta_5 ln(X_5) + \mu$$
### **a) Estimate the parameters of the linear model and interpret the results**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_7.6 %>% 
  lm(formula = "y ~ x2 + x3 + x4 + x5") %>% 
  summary()
```

**A:** With R output, we have the following linear regression model:

$$\hat{Y} = 10.816 - 2.227,7 X_2 + 1.251,1 X_3 + 6,3 X_4 - 197,4 X_5$$
With this regression model, $\alpha_2 = -2.227,7$ indicates that rose demand will be reduced in 2.227 if rose price increases, $\alpha_3 = 1.251,1$ indicates that rose demand will increase if clove price increase, in this case they are substitutes, $\alpha_4 = 6,3$ indicates that rose demnad will increase if average income availability increase and $\alpha_5 = -197,4$ indicate that rose demand is in a fall trend.

### **b) Estimate the parameters of the log-log model and interpret the results**

```{r, echo=T, include=T, message=F,warning=F}
tbl_7.6 %>% 
  lm(formula = "log(y) ~ log(x2) + log(x3) + log(x4) + log(x5)") %>% 
  summary()
```

**A:** With R output, we have the following log-log regression model:

$$\hat{Y} = 0.63 - 1.27 X_2 + 0.94 X_3 + 1.71 X4 - 0.18 X_5$$
Given this regression model, $\beta_2 = -1.27$ indicates that rose demand will fall in 1.27% if rose price increase in 1%, $\beta_3 = 0.93$ indicates that rose demand will increase in 0.93% if clove price increase in 1%, $\beta_4 = 1.71$ indicates that rose demand will increase in 1.71% if average family income availability increase in 1% and $\beta_5 = -0.18$ indicates that rose demand is falling in a trend of -0.18% per quarter.

### **C) The parameters beta 2, 3 and 4 represent price elasticity, cross price elasticity and income elasticity for rose demand?**

**A:** Yes, because they're on transformed by natural log, then small variations can be interpreted as percentual variations. But this model generated parameters with high p-value, then these parameters aren't strong predictors for the variable being studied.

### **7.18) USA's defense budget between 1962 and 1981 is represented by the table 7.8. To explain this budget, use the following model:**

$$Y = \beta_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + \beta_4 X_4 + \beta_5 X_5 + \mu$$
Where 

$Y$ = Anual expenditure with defense in billions

$\beta_2$ = GNP in billions

$\beta_3$ = Sales of militar assistance in billions

$\beta_4$ = Sales from aerospace industry in billions

$\beta_5$ = Militar conflicts with more than 100.000 soldiers. Binary variable (i.e. 1 or 0)


### **Cap.8 Multple Regression Analysis: The Inference Problem**

In this chapter the author record the reader that OLS method to develop regression models doen't make any assumption about the error distribution $\mu$ and the OLS would be fine if the goal is to make point estimation of the parameters of the model. But when the goal is to make estimations about the populational parameters, the normality of $\mu$ assumption will be required.

After, they present multiple hypothesis that can be tested in a multiple regression model, like:

1) Test hypothesis about one coeficient of the model (similar to Simple Regression Models).

2) Test the general significance of the model. In other words, test all the parameters ($\beta$) of the model.

3) Test if two or more parameters are equal.

4) Test if parameters make sense given a particular theory behind the model.

5) Test the model stability given different data samples or different periods.

In this chapter the author gave special attention to the F statistics. That is a metric that indicates the relevance of the paramters choosen for the regression model. Also, they presented the relation between F statistics and RÂ².

Then, to end the chapter, they presented some discussion about when it is necessary to add new variables on a multiple regression model.
