Hi! I'm Francisco, an Economist that enjoy working with data and statistics. Maybe that's
why i'm working with Business Intelligence and Data Warehouse since 2015. This field
allows me to code (mainly in SQL, R and Python), analyse data using statistics and
communicate business research throughout reports and data viz. I try keep learning
different tools and models to solve business problems and increase my capacity to
generate insights from data in a productive way.

On my free time, I like to grab some books (I'm great at finding and store online books to read someday in the future, though this day never comes), watch TV series with my fiance (I prefer documentaries but I always yield), play soccer with my friends and play some games on my PC ([Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/francisco_piccolo), Age of Empires and Dota I are my favorites).

Now, to compete for my free time, there's this blog with a strange name. Bloging is something well recommended for people that want improve their writing skills and promote themselves (it can payoff in an interview if you've developed nice projects). Then, I decided to create one to write about things that I know and also that i'm able to explain in a simple way. Because my career is surrounded by data and statistics, mostly of the post will be related to this (e.g. exploratory data analysis, new R/Python package and so on). The name of the blog isn't the best that you'll see, but the animal (Glass Frog) denotes somethig transparent, a characteristic envisioned in a exploratory data analysis project (at least the ones that I develop). In other words, transparency, in the context of Data Analysis, is when your decision making process is founded by accurate statistical analysis. Thus, this little animal, remembers me of where is my goal when developing a project, that is to make the situation clearer and transparent as possible for the stakeholders.
