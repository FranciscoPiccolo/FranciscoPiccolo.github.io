<p>This post will kick-off my journey as a fundamentalist investor. The posts related to this journey will be placed in a specific page of my website (<strong>Brokerage</strong>), because I’ll share everything related to my strategy as investor and the decisions that I’ll make during the journey.</p>
<p>In this first post, I’ll describe how will be the roadmap of the journey, in order to stay organized. The roadmap is divided in some steps described below:</p>
<div id="defining-who-i-am-on-the-lens-of-the-stock-market" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>1) Defining who I am on the lens of the Stock Market</strong></h3>
<p>Here I’ll define my profile as an investor, being a risk taker or risk averse, long term or short term focused and so on. As I mentioned before, this is my journey as a fundamentalist investor and this fact answer some questions.</p>
<p>As a fundamentalist, I’ll be more long term focused and risk averse. I know that stock market has a high correlation between risk and returns, thus I won’t seek high returns (I’ll define the number in the next step). Also, I will be committed with 1 to 2 hours a week to study my companies, note that this is an arbitrary number and it can be modified in the future. This availability will include moments that I’ll read books about the subject.</p>

<div id="setting-smart-goals-for-the-journey" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>2) Setting smart goals for the journey</strong></h3>
<p>Smart goals are defined as specific, measurable, aggreed-uppon, realistic and time-based, and my journey as an investor has to have a smart goal well defined. Let’s see if it will be inspiring too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In this journey, I will seek a profitability aligned with Ibovespa, being measured in a montly report in this webpage. This journey will last untill december 2026, starting in may 2020 (80 months).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I think it’s pretty specific and measurable, because I’ll take the price of my portfolio and analyze its variation in order to compare with Ibovespa index. After some research, I’ve found that it’s pretty realistic and also conservative. Also, this is a time-based goal because it has a start and an end point.</p>
</div>
<div id="developing-the-strategy" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>3) Developing the strategy</strong></h3>
<p>Now that I know my profile and my goal, I can set a strategy to support my journey. This strategy probably will change, but it’ll be well documented in specific posts.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the defined goal, I’ll first research some companies and understand their foundations and attribute a score for them. After I finish this research I’ll list the companies to make the purchase of the stock and set an hypothesis for each company. The hypothesis will be based on future stock performance. Then, I’ll make the follow-up of the financial data and investor releases of these companies.</p>
<p>Over time, I’ll keep making the researches and analysis in order to add more companies to my portfolio. The loop <strong>research</strong>, <strong>score</strong>, <strong>buy</strong>, <strong>follow-up</strong> can be modified, by the scientific approach won’t change. Also, I’ll sell some stocks if I get suficient evidences that the company won’t support the achievement of the goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="follow-up-and-adapt" class="section level3">
<h3><strong>4) Follow-up and Adapt</strong></h3>
<p>To stay on track of my thoughts and be able to learn with past mistakes, I’ll document my analysis, then I can recap past decisions and assumptions. In a monthly basis I’ll write a report about the performance of the portfolio and this report will contain updates of the companies, financial metrics and hypothesis confirmations (or not). I hope I can stay motivated and with energy to execute everything I’m commiting to.</p>
